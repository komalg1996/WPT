        Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from
        the past, through the present, into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurements used
        to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of
        change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience.Time is often referred to
        as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.
        Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a
        manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.[7][9] Nevertheless,
        diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some
        notion of time into their respective measuring systems.

        Time in physics is operationally defined as "what a clock reads".
        The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in spacetime. Examples of
        events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship. Every
        event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates). However, the
        numerical values are different for different observers. In general relativity, the question of what time it is
        now only has meaning relative to a particular observer. Distance and time are intimately related, and the time
        required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated
        by Michelson and Morley. General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals
        where quantum mechanics holds. At this time, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general
        relativity.
